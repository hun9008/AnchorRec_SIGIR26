# Anchored Alignment: Preventing Positional Collapse in Multimodal Recommender Systems

We develop AnchorRec based on [MMRec]("https://github.com/enoche/MMRec"). Please refer to MMRec for data preparation and basic usage.

We add the following files for AnchorRec implementation:

```

To run AnchorRec, you can either modify MMRec to include these files or simply run the provided `bash run.sh` script.

## Environment Setup

```
conda env create -f env.yaml
```
